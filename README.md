# 🎯 The Perfect Guess Game

A fun Python project where the computer generates a random number and you have to **guess the correct number** in the fewest attempts possible.  
This is my second project uploaded on GitHub 🚀

## 🎮 How to Play
1. The computer randomly selects a number within a range (default: 1–100).
2. You try to guess the number.
3. After each guess, the program will tell you:
   - 📈 "Too High" → your guess is greater than the number  
   - 📉 "Too Low" → your guess is smaller than the number  
   - ✅ "Correct" → you found the number! 🎉
4. The game also keeps track of the **number of attempts** you took.
